# Name
Extended Date/Time module in Haskell

# Description
This is just an experiment Haskell module to clarify my own understanding
of extended Date/Time values, and to tech me Haskell. It is based on simple
Date/Time concepts from [ISO 8601](http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-FDIS-8601.pdf).

Extended datetime concepts are proposed as extension to ISO 8601 and 
publically discussed [at LOC](http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/).

# Usage

    $ cabal configure
    $ ghci src/Data/DateTime/Extended.lhs

# Contribution
